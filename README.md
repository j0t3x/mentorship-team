# Node.js Mentorship Program
I would really like to join this program because i'm a believer of the great help nodejs is making when someone is building software with it. I would really love to gain deeper understanding of the cpp part of nodejs so that i can be more confident when trying to contribute to the more advanced parts of nodejs.
